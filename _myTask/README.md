# To make a simple ALS procedure

### Get training values out of problem
- Compute problem solution on random X-input in interval 
- Store input/output values in csv file

### Build ML model on random set of problem values 
- Train machine learning model in specified number of randomly drawn value pairs from csv file 
- Visualize results 
- Assess and visualize model score and fit 
- Store ml model

<---- here ----> 

### Optimize model in procedure
- Train ml model and repeat until ml model is precise enough
- Extract procedure and generalize

### Generalize and automate training 
- Apply procedure on bigger problems
- Incorporate MOO to automate training
